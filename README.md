OUR EXPERTISE
Our focus is on Healthcare Communication. We believe the heart of a brand strategy starts with the
patient experience. Using our individual competencies and skills, coming from industry and academia,
we leverage the synergies that are generated from our diversity. Our knowledge spans from medicine,
market access, molecular, and human biology, to business and innovation, marketing and strategic
communication, health economics and data analytics, to graphic design, art and illustrations and
motion design.
We work closely with the market access experts at Zealth, providing us the holistic understanding of
pharma and healthcare.
MARKETING & SALES EXCELLENCE
A good brand strategy enables you to identify and utilize your competitive advantage.
Driving demand requires a strategy that is aligned with the specific market, but also operations that
follow all the way through. This requires true understanding of the patient and customer, and tools
that support effective execution, measurement and reporting, and internal engagement. We help you
to unlock these opportunities and ensure that every action you take conveys your brand promise and
maximizes the value of your product.
INSIGHTS & STRATEGY
Today, the customers control what information and communication they want and set their
expectations accordingly.
Therefore, the marketing today must be centered on the needs and beliefs of the individual health
care professionals or patients. A holistic approach using omnichannel engagement provides the
opportunity to maintain HCP contact conveniently and cost-effectively at broad scale. We support you
in creating the customer journey that generates a seamless brand experience.
DESIGN & COMMUNICATION
We help you to identify the most important information for your audience and create visual narratives
that inspire your audiences to act.
We have a deep understanding of medical aspects, and we understand the complexity of presenting
clinical results. We also create concepts that catch attention, generate clear understanding, and
uphold consistency to create differentiation and recognition of your company. Every single element,
be it a chart or an icon, should contribute towards the business goals. Our combined expertise makes
us your ideal Design Partner.
MEDICAL AFFAIRS EXCELLENCE
We know the importance of adapting communication to your audience.
Situations such as internal training and patient communication require the ability to make the
complexity of medicine and research understandable and digestible on a non-expert level. When it
comes to healthcare professionals, communicating clear and correct content is vital, since their
capacity and time to absorb new information is limited. With our extensive background within
medicine, molecular biology, and human biology, from both academic and industry perspectives, we
know how to frame your product propositions in a way that healthcare professionals find relevant and
convincing.
