          <strong>OUR EXPERTISE:</strong> Our focus is on Healthcare Communication. We believe the
          heart of a brand strategy starts with the patient experience. Using our individual
          competencies and skills, coming from industry and academia, we leverage the synergies that
          are generated from our diversity. Our knowledge spans from medicine, market access,
          molecular, and human biology, to business and innovation, marketing and strategic
          communication, health economics and data analytics, to graphic design, art and
          illustrations and motion design. We work closely with the market access experts at Zealth,
          providing us the holistic understanding of pharma and healthcare.

        <p class="info">
          <strong>MARKETING & SALES EXCELLENCE:</strong> A good brand strategy enables you to
          identify and utilize your competitive advantage. Driving demand requires a strategy that
          is aligned with the specific market, but also operations that follow all the way through.
          This requires true understanding of the patient and customer, and tools that support
          effective execution, measurement and reporting, and internal engagement. We help you to
          unlock these opportunities and ensure that every action you take conveys your brand
          promise and maximizes the value of your product.
        </p>

        <p class="info">
          <strong>INSIGHTS & STRATEGY:</strong> Today, the customers control what information and
          communication they want and set their expectations accordingly. Therefore, the marketing
          today must be centered on the needs and beliefs of the individual health care
          professionals or patients. A holistic approach using omnichannel engagement provides the
          opportunity to maintain HCP contact conveniently and cost-effectively at broad scale. We
          support you in creating the customer journey that generates a seamless brand experience.
        </p>

        <p class="info">
          <strong>DESIGN & COMMUNICATION:</strong> We help you to identify the most important
          information for your audience and create visual narratives that inspire your audiences to
          act. We have a deep understanding of medical aspects, and we understand the complexity of
          presenting clinical results. We also create concepts that catch attention, generate clear
          understanding, and uphold consistency to create differentiation and recognition of your
          company. Every single element, be it a chart or an icon, should contribute towards the
          business goals. Our combined expertise makes us your ideal Design Partner.
        </p>

        <p class="info">
          <strong>MEDICAL AFFAIRS EXCELLENCE:</strong> We know the importance of adapting
          communication to your audience. Situations such as internal training and patient
          communication require the ability to make the complexity of medicine and research
          understandable and digestible on a non-expert level. When it comes to healthcare
          professionals, communicating clear and correct content is vital, since their capacity and
          time to absorb new information is limited. With our extensive background within medicine,
          molecular biology, and human biology, from both academic and industry perspectives, we
          know how to frame your product propositions in a way that healthcare professionals find
          relevant and convincing.
